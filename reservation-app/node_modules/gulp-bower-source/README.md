gulp-bower-src
==============

Map Bower dependencies.

If you are using Gulp.js with Bower, you might need to map the main files from the Bower dependecies.
This will help you map all the Main files from your Bower dependencies.

This implementation is based on: Christopher Kn√∂tschke's implementation that can be found at:
https://github.com/ck86/gulp-bower-files.git

The only difference is that this will output an object of your main files
